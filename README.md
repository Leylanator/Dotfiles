# Dotfiles
Just my dotfiles. Organised... Sort of.

Assume that the files go into `~/.config/<directory name>/` unless specified otherwise.

Config files may require dependencies to work as intended. I will assume that the user can search to find what they are (such as lazyvim with luarocks, or utilites I may use in tiling window managers which may not be installed on a different system (like feh)).

There is also a chance that styling elements, such as font or shape sizes, may not scale well automatically. I encourage a tinker to get it right on your screen. These are dotfiles which are, of course, duplicated from my usecases. Monitor resolution and size - or even just preference - may differ.

Happy dotfiling!
